<p>The goal of the project is to utilise an audio signal to generate a string of random numbers to be used for one-time passwords(OTP).
From a playlist of 25000 songs, the user would use the random shuffle feature to play a song randomly when he/she wants to generate an OTP.
The voltage of the audio signal is then converted by a CMOD-A7's XADC to a digital output that acts as the seed for the random number generation.</p>
